How to change github repository name and update on local

# Answer from ChatGPT

To change the name of a Github repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Github website, and navigate to the repository you want to rename.

2. In the repository page, click on the "Settings" button.

3. In the "Settings" page, you will see a field called "Repository name". Here, you can change the name of the repository.

4. After you have changed the name, click on the "Rename" button to save the changes.

To update the local repository with the new name, you can use the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

1. Navigate to the local repository directory using the command line.

2. Use the command `git remote set-url origin [new repository URL]` to update the remote repository URL with the new repository name.

3. Use the command `git pull` to update your local repository with the latest changes.

That's it! Your Github repository name and local repository should now be updated with the new name.
